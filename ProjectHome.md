# Important #
**This code is unmaintained for years and, while it still works, depends on a deprecated library (Interface).**

I recommend using the plugin from Manuele J Sarfatti http://mjsarfatti.com/sandbox/nestedSortable/, who spared me from the work of having to port this to jQueryUI.

# About #

The NestedSortables are a set of two [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) plugins, build on top of the [Interface](http://interface.eyecon.ro) for jQuery, that allows you to sort and nest elements using drag and drop.

# [NestedSortable](NestedSortableDocumentation.md) #

The first, low level one is the [NestedSortable](NestedSortableDocumentation.md). It can be set up very similarly to the [Sortable](http://interface.eyecon.ro/docs/sort) plugin in Interface. You can check its documentation, with examples, [here](NestedSortableDocumentation.md). A working demo can be seen in [this page](http://www.bernardopadua.com/nestedSortables/test/nested_sortable/).

# [NestedSortable Widget](NestedSortableWidgetDocumentation.md) #

The second, high level one is a widget or component. It is called [NestedSortable Widget](NestedSortableWidgetDocumentation.md) (I have a great imagination). You can check its documentation, with examples, [here](NestedSortableDocumentation.md). A working demo can be seen in [this page](http://www.bernardopadua.com/nestedSortables/test/widget/).

# Additional Information #

These plugins were developed for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) as a Google Summer of Code project, in 2007. They were designed to allow the user to easily sort their blog pages.

More information about the development of this plugin can be seen in my [blog](http://bitsinashortbit.wordpress.com/tag/google-summer-of-code/).
